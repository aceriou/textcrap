# textcrap
A dead simple text paste website similar to Pastebin, written entirely by Preston Cammarata

# Setting up
Just copy the files to your server, create a database and name it whatever you want, run the "db.sql" file in the database to create the needed table for textcrap, then fill out the database credentials in crap.php.

It's super simple.
